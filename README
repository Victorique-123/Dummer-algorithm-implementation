1.The algorithm is implemented in python in the file 'Dummer's algorithm', the function decoding() accepts code words with errors, the parity matrix H and Граница Варшамова - Гилберт D. Output The correct code word c.

2.The Binary Symmetric Channe is simulated in the file 'Channel simulation' and can be used to inject errors into the code word with a given BER

3.The function in the file 'Data generation' generates a random checksum matrix of the specified size (starting rate R=0.5), as well as a random syndrome

4.The function find_e() in the file "task of syndrom" can be used to solve the syndrome decoding problem
